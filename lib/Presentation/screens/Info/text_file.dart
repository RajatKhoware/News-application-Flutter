const String aboutText =
    '''Hey there my name is Rajat khoware, As a self-taught developer, I have always been driven by a desire to learn and create. I have a passion for technology and a curiosity that pushes me to constantly seek out new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills.
\nI currently live in Indore and am completing my eighth semester of electrical engineering. In my free time, I love to read books and learn about new technologies. I am also a musician and enjoy playing the guitar.
\nOver the years, I have taught myself a variety of programming languages and frameworks, and have worked on a range of projects, from simple websites to complex mobile applications. And while I have faced my fair share of challenges along the way, I have always been willing to put in the hard work and dedication needed to succeed.
\nOne of my most recent projects was a news app that I built using Flutter, a powerful mobile application development framework. It was a challenging and rewarding project that tested my skills and pushed me to learn more about Flutter and mobile app development. In the end, I was able to create a finished product that I was proud of, and I gained a lot of valuable experience and knowledge in the process.
\nI am always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn, and I am excited to see where my journey as a developer takes me next.''';

    '''As a self-taught developer, I was always looking for ways to challenge myself and showcase my skills. That's why I decided to create a news app using Flutter, a powerful mobile application development framework. I was drawn to Flutter because of its fast development cycle, expressive and flexible UI, and strong support for integration with external platforms and APIs.
\nWith the help of the active Flutter community, I was able to quickly build a feature-rich app that performed well on a variety of devices. The finished product was a sleek and user-friendly news application that kept users informed and up-to-date on the latest happenings from around the world. And as I looked at the final product, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in my work as a self-taught developer.''';

const String desginProcessText =
    '''As I began to work on my news app, I quickly realized that I had no idea where to start when it came to the design. I had no clue what the best design for a news app would be, so I turned to Google for help. After hours of research and browsing through various websites, I stumbled upon Dribble.com, a site full of beautiful and inspiring UI designs.
\nI spent hours pouring over the various designs on Dribble, looking for ones that would be suitable for a news app. Eventually, I found several that caught my eye and decided to use them as inspiration for my own design. I combined elements from each of the designs I liked, and even came up with a few original ideas of my own when I couldn't find references for certain parts of the app.
\nIt wasn't easy, but in the end, I was able to create a design that I was truly proud of. The finished product was a sleek and user-friendly news app that was visually appealing and easy to navigate. And even though I had no design experience to speak of, I was able to create something that I was truly proud of.''';

const challengesFacedText =
    '''As I worked on my news app, I faced a number of challenges that tested my skills as a developer. One of the biggest challenges I faced was finding a good UI for the app. I wanted to create a minimal and trendy UI, but it was difficult to come up with a design that would be both visually appealing and functional.
\nOnce I had a design in mind, I started working on implementing it. At first, things went smoothly and I was able to make good progress. But when it came time to integrate the API, I hit a snag. I was able to get the correct responses from the API, but displaying the data in the different parts of the UI was much more difficult. With more than seven categories to display, as well as a search feature and news by country support, it was a challenge to manage all the different elements and make sure everything was working properly.
\nI also ran into a simple error that took me two days to solve. It was a null data error that I couldn't figure out at first. But after investing a lot of time and effort into solving it, I finally realized that I just had to use some simple if-else conditions to fix the problem.
\nOverall, working on my news app was a challenging and rewarding experience. Despite the difficulties I faced, I was able to create a finished product that I was proud of, and I learned a lot along the way.''';

const String newsAppText =
    '''As I sat at my desk, staring at the blank screen in front of me, I knew I had to come up with a way to showcase my skills as a self-taught Flutter developer. That's when the idea for a news app hit me. I was determined to create something that would not only demonstrate my abilities, but also provide a valuable resource for users looking to stay informed about the latest happenings from around the world.
\nAfter a week of hard work and long hours, my news app was finally complete. And as I navigated through its sleek and user-friendly interface, I knew I had created something special.
\nOn the home screen, users could find live news from a variety of categories, including investment, business, tech, health, politics, science, international, and sports. Within each category, users could find top headlines, news by nation, news by different sources from the domain, hot news, and all news related to that category. If users clicked on any of the headlines, they were taken to a page with all the headlines from that category.
\nBut the app didn't just stop there. The search screen allowed users to find news on any topic they could think of, simply by typing it into the search bar. And with the country screen, users could stay informed about what was happening in their own country, with news sorted by category and location.
\nFinally, the fourth screen provided some information about the app, including its purpose and features.
\nAs I looked at the finished product, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. I had created a valuable resource for users and proven to myself that I had the skills to succeed as a self-taught Flutter developer. And who knows, maybe one day my app will become the go-to source for news around the world.''';
